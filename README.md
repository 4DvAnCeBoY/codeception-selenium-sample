# codeception-selenium-sample
A Sample codeception app to run selenium automation tests on LambdaTest grid. 

### Prerequisites
- Install php and composer on your system. Setup Instructions for the same can be found  [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Quick+Guide+To+Run+PHP+Tests+on+LambdaTest+Selenium+Grid) 

### Installation
```bash
# setup project dependencies
composer install
```

- Create go to tests/acceptance.suite.yml
- Replace `{username}` with your LambdaTest username. It can be obtained from [LambdaTest dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/)
- Replace `{token}` with your access key. It can be generated from [LambdaTest dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/) 

#####  Routing traffic through your local machine

>    - [Windows](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Local+Testing+For+Windows)
>    - [Mac](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Local+Testing+For+MacOS)
>    - [Linux](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/display/TD/Local+Testing+For+Linux)

### Important Note:
Some Safari & IE browsers, doesn't support automatic resolution of the URL string "localhost". Therefore if you test on URLs like "http://localhost/" or "http://localhost:8080" etc, you would get an error in these browsers. A possible solution is to use "localhost.lambdatest.com" or replace the string "localhost" with machine IP address. For example if you wanted to test "http://localhost/dashboard" or, and your machine IP is 192.168.2.6 you can instead test on "http://192.168.2.6/dashboard" or "http://localhost.lambdatest.com/dashboard".

### Run tests
```bash
./vendor/bin/codecept run --steps
```
